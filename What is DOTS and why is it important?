DOTS = Data Orientedd Tech Stack

DOTS enables you to take advantage of multicore processors to parallelize data processing 
and increate the performance of Unity projects.

DOTS - extension to the Unity engine. 

DOTS - combination of technologies that work together to deliver a data oriented approach to coding in Unity. Data oriented coding.
DOTS consists of: 
1 - ESC Entity Component System (ECS) - provides framework using data oriented approach, it is distrtibuted through the Entities package. (You can add the Edittor through Package Manager). 
2 - JOBS C# - provides simple method of generating multi-threaded code. It is disctrubuted through the Jobs package
3 - BURST Burst Compiler - generates fast and optimized native code. Distributed through the Burst package, available in the Editor through the Package Manager.
4 - Native containers - ESC data structures which provides control over memory

- The 1-3 elements are referred as three pillars of DOTS. 
- Separate packages
- Together = foundation of delivering performant data oriented solutions

- Using DOTS as ECS - way to structure and white code that can have separe info - behaviors from data
- Allows arrange data in logical way 
- ECS - provides a way to define how data is orgamised in memory amd how it is accessed by the CPU

Project TIny is a lightweight version of Unity that provides DOTS for mobile devices
