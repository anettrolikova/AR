Types of movement
In AR experiences, there are four different ways that a user can move.
Seated, with hands fixed
Seated, with hands moving
Standing still, with hands fixed
Moving around in a real-world space

For each user case, try to:
Let users know what movements will trigger the app.
Guide them through the types and range of movement possible.
Make easy transitions from one pose or movement to another.
Design for comfort. Try to avoid making the user do anything that’s physically demanding, uncomfortable, or too sudden.
Try not to require movement until it’s necessary. Getting users to move is a great way to engage them, but let them ease into the experience.
